## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-26

### Added

#### Core Features
- Email classification system combining AI (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini) with heuristic fallback
- Web interface with drag-and-drop file upload functionality
- RESTful API with comprehensive OpenAPI documentation
- Support for PDF and TXT file processing
- Two classification categories: **Produtivo** and **Improdutivo**

#### AI & NLP
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration with configurable models
- Heuristic classification based on keyword matching
- NLP preprocessing with spaCy and NLTK
- Confidence scoring for classification results
- Automatic fallback to heuristics when AI is unavailable

#### Infrastructure
- Docker multi-stage builds (development and production)
- Docker Compose orchestration with service profiles
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Comprehensive test suite (62 tests, 58% coverage)
- Production deployment scripts with rollback capability

#### Developer Experience
- Automated development environment setup (`dev-setup.sh`)
- Code quality enforcement (Black, isort, flake8)
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality validation
- Comprehensive documentation and contribution guidelines
- Performance benchmarking and monitoring

### Security
- Container running as non-root user
- Input validation and sanitization
- Environment variable configuration for secrets
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Technical Specifications
- **Python**: 3.12+
- **Framework**: FastAPI with Jinja2 templates
- **AI Provider**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (with Hugging Face fallback)
- **Database**: File-based (no persistent storage)
- **Container**: Multi-stage Docker builds
- **Testing**: pytest with 58% code coverage
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose + production scripts
